## Server: DB

### How to run DB:

```console
docker run --name teams -p 3306:3306 -v <Dtabase volume on the local filesystem>:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin -d mariadb:latest
```

### Flyway

- It's a database migration tool

```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
            <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```

#### Why did we use it?

Default schema doesn't work because of SQL dialect problem

```java
 auth.jdbcAuthentication()
      .dataSource(dataSource)
      .withDefaultSchema()
      .withUser(User.withUsername("ADMIN")
        .password(passwordEncoder().encode("admin"))
        .roles("ADMIN"));
```

So, it was necessary to manually create USERS and AUTHORITIES tables and override the custom query:

```java
usersByUsernameQuery(
                        "select username,password, enabled from users where username=?")
               .authoritiesByUsernameQuery(
                       "select username, authority from authorities where username=?")
                .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
                .withUser(User.withUsername("admin") //to comment after the admin has been inserted
                        .password(passwordEncoder().encode("admin"))
                        .roles("ADMIN"));

```

However in this way, two issue come out:

1. we want to keep the benefits of automatic table generation: spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true 
2. we would like to add ADMIN only at the first run automatically;

Solutions:

- db.migration 
    - V2__create_auth_tables.sql
    - V3__contraints.sql 
- flyway schema history table
- spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate = true

The DB reaches 3 version during the application first run:

0. init;
1. creation of the base tables;
2. creation of USER and AUTHORITIES tables;
3. creation of the ix_auth_username contraint between the two tables;

The ADMIN is added only after this creation.

       }
    
    "image" = file jpeg



### Courses

#### Creation/removal

Only a professor can create a course; only the professor created a course can remove it.
A course can be removed only if it has been disabled first.
The removal of the course cause the removal of assignments, homeworks and teams associated to it.

    Creation:   API/courses/ (POST)   
    
                {
                    "name":"Applicazioni Internet",
                    "acronime":"AI",
                    "max":10
                    "min": optional
                }
                
    Removal: API/courses/{course} (DELETE)

#### Update 

Only a professor owning a course can update it.
It is impossible to set minimum/maximum values such that to invalidate teams already present within the course.
    
       Update:  API/courses/update (POST)
       
                {
                    "name":"Applicazioni Internet",
                    "acronime":"AI",
                    "max":10
                    "min": optional
                }
            

#### Enable/disable 

Only the professor having the ownership of a course, can enable/disable that course.
Disabling a course means also disabling all the VM instances associated to it.

    Enable: API/courses/{course}/enable (POST)
    Disable: API/courses/{course}/disable (POST)
    
#### Access to course

    All:   API/courses/ (GET)
    One:   API/courses/{course} (GET)

#### Share ownership

Only a professor already having the ownership for a course, can share it with another professor not already having the ownership for the same course.
 
    API/courses/{course}/share (POST)
    {
        "id":{professor}     
    }

#### Enroll/Unsubscribe
Only a professor owning the course can enroll/unsubscribe students present in the DB for an **enabled** course.
The removal of a student from a course cause the eventually removal of him from a team; if after the remotion, the team members' size goes under the min threshold for the course, the team is removed too.
  
    Enroll One: API/courses/{course}/enrollOne (POST)

                        }
                
Any authenticated user can access to the enrolled students information:

    getEnrolled:    API/courses/{name}/enrolled (GET)
    
    
### Teams

A student enrolled in a course can propose a team for that course. The proposed team is created only after all the team members accepted the invitation.

#### Proposal

        propose a team: API/courses/{name}/proposeTeam (POST)

        accept:
        
        reject:
        
#### Team info

A student enrolled in a course or the professor can see the information on team for that course. Only students in a team can see adhesion information of the other members.

        adhesion info:  API/courses/{course}/teams/{id}/adhesion      (GET)

                                }
                    

### VM instances

#### Creation

A student can create a VM instances for a team for which it is a member, only if the requested resources are available among the reserved ones.
